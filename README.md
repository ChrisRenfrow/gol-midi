# gol-midi (Game of Life MIDI)

## What?

gol-midi is an program that generates configurable MIDI signals based on Game of Life board-state.

## Why?

I wanted a way to consume my [`gol-lib`](https://github.com/ChrisRenfrow/gol-lib) project as a library to test it from the user's perspective.

### Yeah, but why MIDI?

I have an idea to make generative music influenced by game of life board-state. There are probably easier ways to do this but I thought it would be interesting to learn more about MIDI in the process.
